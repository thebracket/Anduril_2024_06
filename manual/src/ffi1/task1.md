# {optional} Task: A C addition library, import into Rust and unit test in Rust

IF we have time and people's compilers were behaving, lets try a quick exercise:

* Create a C library that offers addition and subtraction.
* Setup a build script and `bindgen`.
* Call the C from your Rust program.
* Add unit tests to make sure that your Rust and C are actually equivalent.

> Bonus points if you notice that C and Rust handle wrapping/overflow differently!
