## Rules of the Road

* This class was put together for *you* - so if you run into trouble, want to ask about anything (if its too hard, I may answer later or at a break!) --- please do.
    * We often learn more from the questions than the content!
* We'll be trying to structure each day to have breaks.
* I'm deaf. My hearing aids are great, but if I'm not facing you---I may not hear you. If I'm not noticing someone's question, please let me know!

## Format

We'll be loosely dividing sections into different formats:

* **Interactive Lecture**. I'll talk a bit and show examples. You're encouraged to try the examples yourself, participate and ask questions.
* **Workshop/Task**. I'll give you a specification, relating to what we've talked about. You'll try and get it working. If you get stuck, myself and everyone else here is encouraged to help. *This isn't high school!* I'm not going to put you in detention, or complain that you downloaded the code from GitHub! But I would encourage you to participate, and learn.
* **Code Along**. Sometimes, a topic is complicated enough that it would be pretty mean of me to say "Ok guys, write a procedural macro derivation and apply it to a nested structure with references." For those, we'll go through step by step. I have the steps in the workbook, but we can live code on the projector - or work through and you get it working.

Some things are marked as `Optional`. I don't know how quickly you will complete tasks---so there's probably more material than we need. If we're chugging along fast, we'll include the optional stuff. If not, we'll skip it --- but you have it all in the workbook for personal study.
