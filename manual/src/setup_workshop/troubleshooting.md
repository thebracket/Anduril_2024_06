# If you had Trouble


*If This Didn't Work*, your Rust tooling isn't working. Some troubleshooting steps:

1. Make sure that you installed Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and either followed the "source" instruction or opened a new terminal session.
2. Make sure that typing `rustc --version` shows you a version number.
3. If you received the message `linker not found`, you need to install `build-essential` (on Ubuntu/Debian type distributions) or an equivalent on Linux. If you are using MacOS, you need the build package. On Windows, Rustup will show you a link to the appropriate MSVC runtime.
