# Hello World

> "Oh no, yet another Hello World"

> The source code for this section is in `projects/hello_world`. You really shouldn't need to clone that one!

## Step 1: Select a Parent Directory

Create a directory on your computer in which you will be placing projects we work on. We'll be placing projects underneath this directory. For example:

```bash
cd /home/herbert/rust
mkdir rust_training
cd rust_training
```

## Step 2: Invoke `cargo` to Create a New Project

In your project directory, type:

```bash
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
```

## Step 3: Run Your Program!

Cargo creates `hello world` by default when you create a new project. It's all written! Invoke it by typing:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see the following output:

```
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (/home/herbert/Documents/Ardan/KLA Training 3 Day Milipitas/projects/hello_world)
   ...
Hello, world!
```

> It compiled! Ship it!

Seriously, that was what we needed to make sure that you're going to be able to follow along and participate in workshop exercises!
